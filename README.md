## What it does

A customer sends a WhatsApp message — text or voice note — at 22:40 on a Sunday. The AI understands
what they want, checks the real availability on your calendar, books the appointment, and confirms
it. When the message needs a person instead, it escalates to you and tells the customer someone is
coming.

- **Receives WhatsApp messages and voice notes**, around the clock
- **Understands intent and books real appointments** on Google Calendar, with confirmations and reminders
- **Hands off to a human** when a guardrail fires or the customer asks — the conversation flips state, you get an email, the customer is told
- **Multi-tenant**: each tenant connects its own WhatsApp number and configures its own hours, services, knowledge base and assistant persona

## Honest state of play

Most open-source READMEs describe the best version of the project. This one describes the actual
one. The full breakdown, with the commands to reproduce every number, is in
**[docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md](docs/PROJECT-STATUS.md)**.

| Layer | State |
|---|---|
| Domain services (`src/server/`) | **Real.** Booking with availability and a GiST constraint against double-booking, Stripe subscription lifecycle, WhatsApp outbox with `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED`, retry/backoff and dead-letter, webhook idempotency, Google Calendar OAuth, pgvector RAG, GDPR Art. 15/17. |
| Database (`supabase/migrations/`) | **Real.** 22 tables, RLS on every one, `timestamptz` throughout, money as integer cents. |
| Security primitives | **Real.** Stripe signature over the raw body, timing-safe secret comparison, HMAC-signed OAuth state bound to the tenant, AES-256-GCM for stored credentials, nonce-based CSP. |
| Self-service signup | **Working.** Register → magic link → `/auth/callback` → onboarding → dashboard, with auth guards on every authenticated segment. |
| Tenant dashboard | **Working.** Dashboard, conversations inbox with operator reply, calendar, billing, WhatsApp settings, business hours, services, AI persona, knowledge base — all reading live tenant data. |
| Multi-tenant WhatsApp | **Working.** Each tenant connects its own number. The API key is encrypted at rest and resolved per tenant at send time; a number cannot be claimed by a second tenant. |
| Human escalation | **Working.** Status change, operator email with context and a deep link, and an acknowledgement to the customer. |
| Background jobs | **Working.** Seven cron jobs, with a regression test tying `vercel.json` to the exported route handlers. |
| Data retention | **Working.** A daily job enforcing exactly the thresholds the privacy policy states, with a dry-run mode and a test that fails if code and policy diverge. |
| Alerting | **Partial.** A watchdog emails an alert when the outbound queue stops draining. No Sentry yet, so individual exceptions are logged but not aggregated. |
| Tenant isolation | **Partly proven.** Repository filters are covered by regression tests that fail when a `tenant_id` filter is deleted. RLS itself is still never exercised at runtime. **The most important open item.** |
| Cross-tenant admin panel | **Not wired.** Those reads bypass RLS and need a dedicated service with isolation tests. The screens say so rather than showing invented data. |

**41 frontend pages · 41 API routes · 22 tables · 544 unit and integration tests · 56 Playwright E2E
tests · production build verified · zero vulnerabilities in production dependencies.**

## Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Hiberius/whatsapp-receptionist.git
cd whatsapp-receptionist
cp .env.example .env.local
npm ci
npm run dev
```

Open <http://localhost:3000>.

The marketing site, pricing, verticals, blog, help centre and legal pages render immediately with no
credentials at all. To reach the dashboard you need a Supabase project (free tier is enough) — the
rest of the integrations are optional and feature-gated: without an Anthropic key the AI simply does
not reply, without Resend the mailer logs instead of sending, and so on. Nothing throws because a
key is missing.

`./scripts/setup.sh` walks through the variables interactively. The full reference is in
[`.env.example`](.env.example), documented inline.

For production, see [`docs/deployment.md`](docs/deployment.md).

## Features

|     |     |
|-----|-----|
| **WhatsApp + voice** | Text and voice notes through the 360dialog Business API (an official Meta BSP) plus ElevenLabs speech-to-text. No Baileys, no scraped clients. |
| **Real bookings** | Google Calendar OAuth, availability from real business hours and services, database-level protection against double-booking, confirmations and reminders. |
| **Human escalation** | Guardrails on sensitive topics, explicit handoff requests, operator notification, and an acknowledgement to the customer so silence is never the answer. |
| **Editable AI persona** | Each tenant can rewrite the assistant's personality. Safety and output rules are composed around it and cannot be overridden. |
| **Knowledge base with RAG** | pgvector semantic retrieval over documents the tenant uploads — prices, cancellation policy, directions, FAQs. |
| **GDPR-native** | Art. 15 export and Art. 17 deletion endpoints, audit logging, automatic PII redaction in logs, EU hosting, and a retention job that enforces the published policy. |
| **Stripe + Italian SDI** | Subscriptions and Customer Portal, plus electronic invoicing for Italian B2B through Fatture in Cloud. |
| **Multi-tenant by construction** | Row Level Security on all 22 tables, per-tenant WhatsApp credentials, tenant-scoped everything. |

## GDPR & security

Built for the European market, and the defaults reflect it.

- **Row Level Security on all 22 tables**, verified by `npm run db:lint`, which derives the table list from the migrations themselves rather than a hand-maintained allowlist
- **Webhook signature verification** with timing-safe comparison (Stripe over the raw body, WhatsApp shared secret)
- **Credentials encrypted at rest** with AES-256-GCM — OAuth tokens and per-tenant WhatsApp API keys
- **CSP nonce per request**, HSTS, COEP, COOP, CORP, `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- **Automatic PII redaction** in logs: email, phone, fiscal code, VAT number, IBAN, tokens
- **Rate limiting** with named policies per endpoint
- **GDPR Art. 15 export and Art. 17 deletion** with audit logging
- **Data retention** enforced daily against the thresholds the privacy policy publishes
- **Zero vulnerabilities in production dependencies**, enforced by a CI gate. One dev-only advisory is knowingly accepted, with its reopening condition written down in [`docs/SECURITY-AUDIT-NOTES.md`](docs/SECURITY-AUDIT-NOTES.md)

**Known limitation, stated plainly:** server modules use the service-role client, which bypasses
RLS. Isolation currently rests on hand-written `tenant_id` filters, now covered by regression tests
that fail when a filter is removed — but the policies themselves are never exercised at runtime.
Proving isolation against a real Postgres in CI is the top priority for v0.3.

---

## Quality gate

```bash
npm run verify   # typecheck + lint + 544 tests + RLS coverage
npm run build    # production build
npm run test:e2e # 56 Playwright tests, no credentials required
```

CI runs six jobs on every pull request: **verify**, **coverage**, **production build**,
**E2E**, **secret scan (gitleaks)** and **production dependency audit**. The secret scan and the
audit are blocking — a gate that cannot fail is not a gate.

A note on the build: `npm run verify` does **not** include it, and `next build` catches things
`tsc --noEmit` cannot, such as invalid exports from a `route.ts`. Run both.

---

## Screenshots

| | |
|---|---|
| Pricing | <img src="docs/screenshots/pricing-1280.png" alt="Pricing page" width="100%" /> |
| Vertical (dental) | <img src="docs/screenshots/dental-1280.png" alt="Dental vertical page" width="100%" /> |
| Service status | <img src="docs/screenshots/status-1280.png" alt="Status page with live dependency probes" width="100%" /> |
| Landing (mobile) | <img src="docs/screenshots/landing-mobile.png" alt="Landing page on mobile" width="45%" /> |

The status page runs real probes against Supabase, Upstash, Stripe and Anthropic at request time. It
deliberately publishes no historical uptime percentage, because nothing measures one yet.

Authenticated screens are not shown here: capturing them would need a tenant with real
conversations, and filling them with invented data is exactly what this project spent a release
removing.

---

## A note on branding

The repository is the generic **WhatsApp Receptionist**. The application still ships with the
**Ambrogio.ai** brand — copy, logo and Italian marketing pages — because that is the product it was
extracted from. Everything user-facing is yours to replace: strings live in the marketing components
and `NEXT_PUBLIC_APP_NAME`, and the design tokens are in `src/styles/tokens.css`.

The interface language is Italian. English translation is not done.

---

## Is this for you?

**A good fit if** you want to self-host an AI receptionist, you are building a booking SaaS and want
a multi-tenant foundation with RLS and Stripe already wired, or you are looking for a substantial
real-world Next.js 15 + Supabase codebase to learn from.

**A poor fit if** you want something that works out of the box without configuring WhatsApp
Business, if you need a language other than Italian today, or if you need cross-tenant
administration — that panel is not wired.

---

## Why this exists

There are AI chatbots and there are booking systems. Nothing combined them with European GDPR rigour
and Italian B2B fiscal compliance. This started as a real deployment for a clinic and became the
thing that was missing.

Version 0.2 was rebuilt with **Claude Opus 5 in ultracode mode** — Anthropic's multi-agent
orchestration. An eight-dimension audit where every auditor was followed by an adversarial verifier
instructed to refute its findings, then parallel implementation workflows. Roughly a third of the
initial findings were refuted or downgraded once a second agent tried to disprove them by reading
the actual files, which is precisely how single-pass AI review fails. The gravest findings were
still verified by hand before anything changed.

What that process found, and what it deliberately left alone, is published in full:
[`docs/audit/2026-07-27-audit-prodotto.md`](docs/audit/2026-07-27-audit-prodotto.md).

If you fork it commercially that is entirely fine — MIT means MIT. Just don't claim you wrote it
from scratch.

---

## Roadmap

Next up, in priority order:

1. **Tenant isolation proven against a real database** — seed two tenants in CI and assert A cannot read B through the RLS policies themselves
2. **Sentry** with source maps and release tracking
3. **Resource and team entities** — a practice with two chairs cannot be modelled today, and one tenant means one user forever
4. **AI generation moved out of the webhook** into a dedicated outbox job
5. **Prompt caching** and a per-tenant AI cost ceiling
6. **Cross-tenant admin panel** on a tested service
7. **Prompt injection defences** and a much larger AI evaluation set

Full list, including longer-term bets: [`docs/ROADMAP.md`](docs/ROADMAP.md).

## The skill behind it

The reasoning in this codebase is packaged as an Agent Skill, so you can apply it on any
stack rather than adopting this one:

**[whatsapp-receptionist-builder](https://github.com/Hiberius/whatsapp-receptionist-builder)**
— the webhook signature over the raw body, the 24-hour customer service window,
idempotency against Meta retries, and double-booking prevention at the database. Plus
offline tools for the two things you cannot test without a phone number.

```
npx skills add Hiberius/whatsapp-receptionist-builder
```

It is one of [ten](https://github.com/Hiberius/hiberius-skills) built the same way.

## Contributing

Pull requests welcome — see [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The repository is primed for [Claude Code](https://claude.com/claude-code): `CLAUDE.md` and
`AGENTS.md` carry the project's conventions, so an agent opening this repo starts with the right
context.

Two house rules worth knowing before you open a PR:

1. **Run `npm run verify` and `npm run build`.** Verify does not include the build.
2. **Don't add a claim the code cannot back.** If a number appears in the README or the UI, it must be reproducible. This project removed an entire layer of invented metrics in 0.2.0 and would rather not grow another.
